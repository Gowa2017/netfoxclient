 * @class puremvc.Mediator
 * @extends puremvc.Notifier
 * 
 * A base Mediator implementation.
 *
 * In PureMVC, Mediator classes are used to mediate communication between a view 
 * component and the rest of the application.
 *
 * A Mediator should listen to its view components for events, and handle them 
 * by sending notifications (to be handled by other Mediators, 
 * {@link puremvc.SimpleCommand SimpleCommands} 
 * or
 * {@link puremvc.MacroCommand MacroCommands}) 
 * or passing data from the view component directly to a 
 * {@link puremvc.Proxy Proxy}, such as submitting 
 * the contents of a form to a service.
 * 
 * Mediators should not perform business logic, maintain state or other 
 * information for its view component, or break the encapsulation of the view 
 * component by manipulating the view component's children. It should only call 
 * methods or set properties on the view component.
 *  
 * The view component should encapsulate its own behavior and implementation by 
 * exposing methods and properties that the Mediator can call without having to 
 * know about the view component's children.
 * 
 * @constructor
 * @param {string} [mediatorName]
 *  The Mediators name. The Mediators static #NAME value is used by default
 * @param {Object} [viewComponent]
 *  The Mediators {@link #setViewComponent viewComponent}.
